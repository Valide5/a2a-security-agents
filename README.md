# a2a-security-agents

This repository houses a collection of security analyzer agents built using the Google Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. These agents function as A2A Servers, exposing specialized security analysis capabilities for various platforms to A2A-compliant clients.

The goal of this project is to provide modular, interoperable security analysis tools that can be easily integrated into multi-agent systems and workflows via the open A2A standard.
